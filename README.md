# Cyberix3D- 3D Game Maker 
###### (RedWebGames-patch-1)
The Cyberix3D Game Maker is an online tool for creating 3D and 2D games for the web, mobile, and desktop. The current technology of the Cyberix3D Engine is Flash Player and we have created this Github repository for creating a new version of the Cyberix3D Engine that will support HTML5 instead of Flash and also support desktop and mobile versions.

The Cyberix3D Engine will take an XML file and run it as a game.
The XML can be generated through any text editor or through a graphics editor with a user-friendly GUI.

You can follow the Cyberix3D projects here:

## Download
Here's the download link for the Urho3D Engine, which is the engine that Cyberix3D will be built on: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1iYF743XmjE3xtIZHiphB09kVyFbJtnyz/view?usp=sharing.  The file also contains a **Visual Studios Community** project file.  Here is the link to download **Visual Studios Community** https://www.visualstudio.com/downloads
this is how you install the engine.
 * **Step 1:** click on the **visual studios link** and download "**Visual Studios Community**" not the other ones.  Also you need to install with **Visual Studios**, **ALT**, and **Visual C++**.
 
 * **Step 2:** Click on the google drive link to download the engine.
 * **step 3:** Unzip the engine to C: (you can unzip anywhere you want but we will be using C:)
 * **step 4:** Go to c:\Urho3D-1_7-Cyberix3D\vs2017\Urho3D.sln and open "Urho3D.sln" in Visual Studios, the project will be a icon instead of ".sln" if you have **Visual Studios Community** already installed.
 
 * **step 5:** Select the startup project from one of the examples on the right side by pressing right click + set as startup project then click "F5" to run the projects.
 
 When we finish the engine core we will post it on our branch, but for now you can use the Urho3D engine or our original adobe flash [Cyberix3D engine](www.gamemaker3d.com).
