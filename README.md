Here is how you install the engine.

 * Step 2: click on the google drive link to download the engine.
 * step 3: Unzip the engine to C: (you can unzip anywhere you want but we will be using C:)
 * step 4: go to c:\Urho3D-1_7-Cyberix3D\vs2017\Urho3D.sln and open "Urho3D.sln" in Visual Studios, the project will be a icon instead of ".sln" if you have Visual Studios Community already installed.
