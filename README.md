Cyberix3D - 3D Game maker

Here is the Urho3D 1.7 engine that will be used to build Cyberix3D [click here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1iYF743XmjE3xtIZHiphB09kVyFbJtnyz/view?usp=sharing),
We have also included a VS 2017 project with all the examples inside.
You can start playing with it by following the next steps.
1. download Visual Studio Community 2017 for free from this link:
https://www.visualstudio.com/downloads, you also are required to install Visual C++, and ALT.

2. Download and unrar the file into c:\Urho3D-1_7-Cyberix3D or anywhere else
3. Open the file C:\Urho3D-1_7-Cyberix3D\vs2017\Urho3D.sln 
if Visual Studios is already installed this will appear as a project not .sln
4. Select the startup project from one of the examples on the right side by pressing right click + set as startup project
5. Run the project with F5
